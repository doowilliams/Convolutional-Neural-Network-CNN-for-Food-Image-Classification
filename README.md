# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-for-Food-Image-Classification

Project: Food Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

* Implemented a deep learning model for classifying food images into different categories using the Keras framework
* Preprocessed the training and testing images using the ImageDataGenerator module from Keras, including rescaling and data augmentation techniques
* Built a CNN model using the Sequential API from Keras, consisting of multiple Conv2D and MaxPool2D layers, a Dropout layer, and two Dense layers
* Compiled the model using categorical crossentropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric
* Trained the model on augmented training data for 100 epochs and evaluated the model on testing data using early stopping
* Plotted the loss and accuracy curves and made predictions using a sample image
* Technologies: Keras, TensorFlow, ImageDataGenerator, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
